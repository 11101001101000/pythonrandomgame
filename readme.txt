This game is a fork of a game made using scratch(the programming language) by my friends.
The file game.py is the first port of the original one. All the dialogues are written in Korean.
The file game_1.py is an English version of it.
If you don't know which file to run, type 'python3 game_1.py' in your terminal or double-click game_1.py file.
Note:The game requires python 3 to run. Python 3.9 and above are recommended.
